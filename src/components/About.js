                A thank you to anime for saving my life; a thank you to the people who make anime for saving my life; and a thank you to the people who license anime for saving my life. Thank you, even if sometimes the anime is bad.

                You will be crying with laughter one second and having your heart twisted a few minutes later, as you stare and wonder at how these stroytellers can find ways to translate the most basic of human emotions using the most unconventional of paths. Anime has consistently and completely defied my expectations time and again, and made me think in ways I never thought possible.

                Well I started watching anime when I was about 5 or 6 years old that was back in 2009/10 and I watched it on TV. First anime I saw was Naruto(still one of my favorites till this day) and then few more. I was absolutely in love with it and this whole 10 years Iâ€™ve been slightly watching anime never actually growing out of the phase as my mother said. Anime, i love you.
